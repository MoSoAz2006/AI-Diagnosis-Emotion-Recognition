# 🤖 AI Diagnosis & Emotion Recognition — Machine Learning & CNN Project

A **dual AI system** featuring:
- 🧠 **Machine Learning model** for predicting possible diseases based on user symptoms.
- 😊 **Deep Learning (CNN)** model for recognizing human emotions from facial images.

Built with **Python**, trained on **real-world datasets**, and designed to showcase the combination of classical ML and modern DL techniques.

😊 Emotion Detection (CNN)

Download and extract the image dataset (e.g., FER2013) into emotion_detection/datasets/.


🚀 Usage
Disease Prediction:
cd disease_prediction
python train_disease.py      # Train the ML model
python predict_disease.py    # Predict disease based on input symptoms

Emotion Detection:
cd emotion_detection
python train_emotion.py      # Train the CNN model
python predict_emotion.py    # Predict emotion from image input

🧩 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

Matplotlib

📊 Results

Achieved high accuracy on both datasets.

Emotion detection model performs effectively on unseen facial images.

Disease prediction model suggests possible conditions based on input symptoms.
